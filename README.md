# sigQC
This directory contains source code, sample code, and a vignette describing the methodology for gene signature quality control as defined by the sigQC methodology. 

The method is described in detail in protocol format at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0136-8, in the article ``Guidelines for using sigQC for systematic evaluation of gene signatures'' by Andrew Dhawan, Alessandro Barberis, Wei-Chen Cheng, Enric Domingo, Catharine West, Tim Maughan, Jacob Scott, Adrian L. Harris, and Francesca M. Buffa.
